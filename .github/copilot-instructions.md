You are the project agent for a Vite + React + TypeScript app.

Always:

- Read existing code first; match established patterns and paths.
- Prefer minimal diffs; do not refactor unrelated files.
- Create/update reusable agent skills in `.agents/skills/**`.
- If you fix a bug or learn a new pattern, append it to the relevant skill file under "Update notes".
- Keep skills concise: When to use, Steps, Pitfalls, Minimal snippet, Update notes.
- Maintain `.agents/skills/_index.json` entries for every skill file.
- Maintain `.agents/skills/_index.json` entries for every skill file.
- Manual review policy: Only run security checks or code reviews when explicitly requested by the user in the prompt (for example: "Run security review" or "Review code"). Do not automatically trigger reviews on every change — this conserves API tokens and reduces noise. Perform reviews after the work is completed, then verify and report whether the review coverage matches the requested scope.
- If tools (e.g., `autoskills`) create skills anywhere in the repo, index those paths in `_index.json` and add minimal glue skills under `.agents/skills/core/` instead of duplicating content.

Architecture rules (src/\*\*):

- Keep all app code under `src/**`.
- Use these canonical folders (in order):
  1. `src/app/**` (app shell, providers, router, layouts)
  2. `src/pages/**` (route-level pages only)
  3. `src/features/**` (feature modules; feature-local UI/hooks/services/types allowed)
  4. `src/components/**` (shared components; UI primitives in `src/components/ui/**`)
  5. `src/services/**` (domain services + API clients; network calls live here)
  6. `src/api/**` (API contracts/types/schemas only; no network calls)
  7. `src/lib/**` (shared helpers/adapters/integrations; cross-cutting utilities)
  8. `src/utils/**` (pure utility functions only; no side effects, no network, no storage)
  9. `src/hooks/**` (shared reusable hooks)
  10. `src/contexts/**` (shared contexts when not feature-scoped)
  11. `src/store/**` (global state if introduced)
  12. `src/styles/**` (global styles)
  13. `src/assets/**` (static assets)
  14. `src/types/**` (global shared types if not feature-scoped)
  15. `src/pwa/**` (PWA utilities; only if PWA is used)

Rules:

- Do not call axios directly in UI/components/pages. Use `src/services/**` (preferred). If the repo already has `src/lib/api/**`, follow the existing pattern.
- Keep page components thin; move logic into `features/`, `services/`, `hooks/`.
- Avoid duplication: do not create new utility folders if `lib/` or `utils/` can be used.
- `src/utils/**` must remain pure (no network, no DOM, no localStorage, no cookies).

Auto-extend rule:

- If a new cross-cutting concern appears (e.g., `workers/`, `analytics/`, `realtime/`):
  1. Create `src/<concern>/**`
  2. Add a short note to `.agents/skills/core/project-conventions.md`
  3. Add/update a skill in `.agents/skills/core/` if it becomes a repeated workflow
  4. Update `.agents/skills/_index.json`

When asked to "generate skills":

- Generate one core skill per workflow and one lib skill per library we use.
- Base snippets on real code in this repository; if missing, create minimal wrappers under `src/services/**` and/or `src/lib/**` first, then reference those exact paths in the skill.
- Ensure every created skill file is registered in `.agents/skills/_index.json` with appropriate tags.
